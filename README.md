The project's motivation lies in addressing the complexity and dynamic nature of influence
networks by leveraging the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms.

The project aims to efficiently navigate large solution
spaces, adapt to evolving network dynamics, and potentially uncover novel influence strategies that
traditional methods might overlook. Ultimately, the goal is to contribute to the development of more
effective and scalable approaches for influence maximization in diverse applications such as
marketing, information spread, and understanding social network dynamics.We introduced a
genetic algorithm, with competition among, and evolution of, populations to obtain solutions for IM
problem. The GA can not only obtain better results but also improve the efficiency of the algorithm. From the experiments, we find that the performance of GA is similar to KGA and even better than
other methods or algorithms.
